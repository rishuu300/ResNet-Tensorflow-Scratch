# ResNet Neural Network Implementation in TensorFlow

This repository contains a custom implementation of the **ResNet** architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.

The project demonstrates the core idea of **Residual Learning** â€” allowing very deep neural networks to be trained effectively by using skip connections.

## ðŸ“– About ResNet

**ResNet** (short for **Residual Network**) introduced the concept of **identity shortcut connections** to skip one or more layers, solving the vanishing gradient problem for deep networks.

Key highlights:
- Introduces **Residual Blocks**.
- Allows training of **extremely deep networks** (e.g., ResNet50, ResNet101).
- Winner of the **ILSVRC 2015** competition.
